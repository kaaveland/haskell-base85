description:         
   Base85 is a binary to text codec that can be used to transfer
   binary data over protocols that have significant whitespace or
   do linefeed or similar.
   
   This is a library that implements the two most common base85
   codecs. It was written to learn cabal and testing with Haskell,
   not for efficiency.
